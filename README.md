# Efficient and accurate detection of viral sequences at single-cell resolution reveals novel viruses perturbing host gene expression

[Click here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/pachterlab/LSCHWCP_2023/blob/main/krona_plot.html) to view the interactive Krona plot showing all viruses expressed above the QC threshold in macaque cells that passed quality control broken down by animal, timepoint, taxonomy, and fraction of positive cells occupied by each virus.

The [precomputed_refs](https://github.com/pachterlab/LSCHWCP_2023/tree/main/precomputed_refs) folder contains precomputed reference indices for the detection of viral RNA in sequencing data (through alignment to the [optimized PalmDB](https://github.com/pachterlab/LSCHWCP_2023/tree/main/PalmDB)) with masked human (or mouse) genome and transcriptome.
