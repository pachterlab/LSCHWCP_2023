The notebooks are organized by Figure as presented in the manuscript.

The host and viral alignments of the macaque PBMC data from [_Kotliar et al._](https://www.cell.com/cell/pdf/S0092-8674(20)31308-8.pdf) with different host masking options are contained within the [align_macaque_PBMC_data](https://github.com/pachterlab/LSCHWCP_2023/tree/main/Notebooks/align_macaque_PBMC_data) folder and referenced in other notebooks as appropriate.

The notebooks build on each other and show all analyses that were performed in the scope of this manuscript, from the raw data to the final figure. Intermediary products are stored on Caltech Data, and each individual notebook should be immediately executable.
