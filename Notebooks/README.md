The **host and viral alignments of the macaque PBMC data from [Kotliar _et al._](https://www.cell.com/cell/pdf/S0092-8674(20)31308-8.pdf) with different host masking options are contained within the [align_macaque_PBMC_data](https://github.com/pachterlab/LSCHWCP_2023/tree/main/Notebooks/align_macaque_PBMC_data) folder** and referenced in other notebooks as appropriate.

The notebooks build on each other and show all analyses that were performed in the scope of this manuscript, from the raw data to the final figure. Intermediary products are stored on [Caltech Data](https://data.caltech.edu/records/sh33z-hrx98?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzUxMiJ9.eyJpZCI6IjlhNDNkZWVkLTRiODYtNDIwMS1hNTcwLTYyNDZhOGYwZjU3YyIsImRhdGEiOnt9LCJyYW5kb20iOiI3YTU1MDY5MjEzY2Y0ZmMyNjVlODMyYTZlOWQ4MTUxMCJ9.RkUlR18JUioegjOX_7m89ngFcatseZGRLZaadwc8X0GgzCxztvnkNc6rUMT8ozAta2LEcpwhdOq33QOH9Slj7g), and each individual notebook should be immediately executable.
