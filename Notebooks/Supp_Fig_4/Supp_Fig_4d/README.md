This gfa file containing the _de Bruijn_ graph was created by inserting the code snippet `dbg.write('graph.gfa')` into the kallisto source code and then running the `kallisto index` command on the clustered (with MMSeqs) PalmDB amino acid sequences (with the `--aa` flag to initiate reverse translatation to comma-free code). To generate the figure shown in the manuscript, the _de Bruijn_ graph was visualized using [Bandage](https://rrwick.github.io/Bandage/).
